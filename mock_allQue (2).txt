Q32. What is distinct and Group by.

-- Distinct:-

  -- The Sql distinct command is used with SELECT key word to retrieve only distinct or unique data.
  -- It returns only distinct (different) values.
  -- In a table there may be a chance to exist a duplicate value and sometimes we want to retrieve only unique values.In such cases, Sql select distinct statement is used.

--- syntax:- 

  select distinct column_name
  from table_name;

-- Group By:-

  -- The Group By statement is used for organizing similar data into groups. 
  -- The data is further organized with the help of equivalent function. 
  -- It means, if different rows in a precise column have the same values, it will arrange those rows in a group.
  
  -- few things to remember while using group by clause are:-
 
--- 1) The SELECT statement is used with the GROUP BY clause in the SQL query.
--- 2) WHERE clause is placed before the GROUP BY clause in SQL.
--- 3) ORDER BY clause is placed after the GROUP BY clause in SQL.

-- SYNTAX:-

    SELECT column1
    FROM table_name  
    WHERE condition  
    GROUP BY column1 
    ORDER BY column1;


-- Difference Between distinct and group by:-

The major difference between the distinct and group by is, group by operator is meant for the aggregating or grouping rows whereas distinct is just used to get distinct values.
